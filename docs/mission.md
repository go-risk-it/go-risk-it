# Mission

The objective for a Risk player is to fulfill the secret mission that has been assigned to them at the beginning of the game.

## Missions

The following are the missions that can be assigned:
* Conquer 18 territories, each defended by at least two armies;
* Conquer 24 territories;
* Conquer all of North America and Africa;
* Conquer all of North America and Oceania;
* Conquer all of Asia and South America;
* Conquer all of Asia and Africa;
* Conquer all of Europe, South America, and a third continent of your choice;
* Conquer all of Europe, Oceania, and a third continent of your choice;
* Eliminate player X. If another player eliminates them first, conquer 24 territories instead.

edge case:
* giovanni has "eliminate francesco" mission
* giovanni currently has 24 territories
* gabriele has "conquer all of North America and Oceania" mission
* gabriele controls all of North America, and is missing only one region in Oceania 
* francesco controls the last region in Oceania
* gabriele eliminates francesco
* now giovanni has to conquer 24 territories
* so both gabriele and giovanni won at the same time
